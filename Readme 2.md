# Note

## I add two extra files {plot3-(w672 - h516).png and plot4-(w672 - h516).png} that were created using the GUI - RStudio in the windows "Plot"  - Export (Save Plot as image..) because with this option we keep the image unchanged as appeared in the screen. The files plot3.png and plot4.png were generated by the corresponding scripts, but are different than appearing in the screen, note the differences in the text of the legend.
This result was due to the size selected of 480 by 480 to create the picture file in the R script.

## Regards Alex
